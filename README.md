Lightweight session system (remembers your conversation until reset)
Upload support (images / documents) for context (optional if implemented)

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

Activate it:
Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

Mac/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

2. Install dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn openai
(The openai package is only used as a client — you are NOT using OpenAI API.)

3. Start Ollama
Ollama usually starts automatically.
If not, run:
ollama serve

4. Run the backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

Backend now runs at:

5. Open the frontend
Open index.html in any browser.

If you use VS Code:
Right‑click → Open with Live Server
